Motivation is currently extremely low. I don't like what I'm doing and what I've been doing for the last year, but I can't change that." I'm sorry if there's nothing interesting in my projects. I try my best, but sometimes I feel like I'm just being lazy. The problem may be deeper, but it doesn't matter. I hope that everything will get better at some point!
